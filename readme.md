# Linear Programming Learning 

Welcome to my Linear Programming Learning Repository! This repository is a collection of my journey in learning and applying linear programming techniques. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, I hope you find the resources and examples here helpful in understanding and mastering linear programming concepts.

## What is Linear Programming?

Linear programming (LP) is a mathematical optimization technique used to find the best outcome in a mathematical model with linear relationships. It is widely used in various fields such as economics, engineering, operations research, and finance to solve complex decision-making problems.

## What I've Learned

In this repository, I've covered the following key aspects of linear programming:

- Basic concepts and terminology in linear programming.
- Formulating optimization problems as linear programming models.
- Solving linear programming problems using different techniques such as the simplex method, graphical method, and optimization libraries in programming languages like Python.
- Advanced topics including sensitivity analysis, integer programming, and duality theory.
- Real-world applications of linear programming in areas such as supply chain optimization, production planning, and resource allocation.
