    "A single-pixel camera is a type of imaging system that captures images using only one light sensor (usually a photodiode or a photomultiplier tube) instead of an array of millions of pixels like in traditional cameras. This approach relies on a technique called compressive sensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compressive sensing exploits the fact that many real-world signals, including images, can be represented using only a small number of non-zero coefficients in a suitable basis. By illuminating the scene with a series of carefully designed patterns and measuring the resulting light intensity with a single sensor, the single-pixel camera can reconstruct an image using algorithms that solve an optimization problem to recover the underlying signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantage of single-pixel cameras is their simplicity and potential for low-cost imaging systems, especially in scenarios where traditional cameras with large arrays of pixels are not feasible or too expensive. They have applications in areas such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and astronomy, among others."

    "A standard digital camera uses a large number of photo sensors to determine the amount of light in each area of the image, referred to as a pixel. For example, a 10 megapixel camera measures 10,000,000 pixels using a CCD or CMOS light sensor. This works very well for optical light and is relatively cheap because of the maturity of CCD and CMOS technology. However, since CCDs and CMOS imagers only work in the optical range, infrared or ultraviolet cameras can be much more difficult and expensive to produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution to this is to use a single pixel camera. A single pixel camera uses only one light sensor to measure the entire image. This allows the use of one really good light sensor as opposed to 10 million very cheap ones. Compressed Sensing is used to measure the entire image using only a single sensor. Compressed Sensing is a mathematical process by which a signal can be undersampled (below the Nyquist rate), and recovered by using L1 minimization, given that the original signal can be represented as a sparse signal and that the sampling process is incoherent to the sparse signal.\n",

    "The primary difference between a single-pixel camera and modern phone cameras lies in their imaging mechanisms and the number of sensors used.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sensor Configuration**:<br>\n",
    "   - Single-pixel Camera: As the name suggests, single-pixel cameras use just one light sensor to capture images. This sensor measures the intensity of light reflected from the scene.\n",
    "   - Modern Phone Cameras: Phone cameras typically use an array of millions of individual pixels (or photosites) arranged on an image sensor. Each pixel captures light independently, and together they form a high-resolution image.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. **Imaging Process**:<br>\n",
    "   - Single-pixel Camera: These cameras use a technique called compressive sensing, where the scene is illuminated with a series of patterns, and the resulting light intensity is measured by the single sensor. Algorithms are then used to reconstruct the image from these measurements.\n",
    "   - Modern Phone Cameras: Phone cameras capture images directly by converting the incoming light into digital data using the array of pixels on the image sensor. This data is processed by dedicated image processing hardware and software to produce the final image.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. **Resolution and Image Quality**:<br>\n",
    "   - Single-pixel Camera: Due to their reliance on compressive sensing and the use of a single sensor, single-pixel cameras typically have lower resolution and may exhibit more noise in the reconstructed images compared to traditional cameras.\n",
    "   - Modern Phone Cameras: Phone cameras can capture high-resolution images with excellent detail and color accuracy due to their large arrays of pixels and sophisticated image processing algorithms.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "4. **Applications**:<br>\n",
    "   - Single-pixel Camera: These cameras are often used in specialized applications where cost, size, or complexity constraints make traditional cameras impractical. They find applications in areas such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and scientific research.\n",
    "   - Modern Phone Cameras: Phone cameras are ubiquitous and versatile, used for everyday photography, videography, augmented reality applications, and more.\n",
